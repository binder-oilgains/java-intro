    "Use the Scanner object to enable users to enter text as input to your program. The Scanner library is **not** imported into your code by default (unlike the Math library), so you need to manually import it using the statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import java.util.Scanner;`\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement needs to go **outside** of any class or method (usually you would just put import statements at the very top of your program). Since Jupyter Notebooks doesn't really have specific class definitions, you'll see that it is grouped in with the other code in the example below, but when coding in Eclipse you will need to have this statement outside of your class definition. In other words, you would need it to look like:\n",

    "~~~\n",
    "import java.util.Scanner;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class MyClass\n",
    "{\n",

    "  {\n",
    "    // Some code here\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have imported the library, you need to create a Scanner object. You can name your Scanner whatever you want; I usually name mine `in` since we use it to read input from the user. To create your Scanner, the code is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Scanner yourVariableName = new Scanner(System.in);`\n",
    "\n",
    "thus you'll see in the code below I have:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `System.in` argument tells Java to create a Scanner that reads in from the main system input (i.e., the user's keyboard). You can also use a Scanner to read in data from files, rather than reading in input from the user's keyboard, by giving the Scanner a link to some file rather than to `System.in`, but we will cover that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created your Scanner, you can use it to read in data from the user. Common methods you might use include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `next()` - reads in characters till the user types a space or newline (i.e., hits enter) and returns whatever the user typed as a `String`\n",
    "- `nextLine()` - reads in an entire line of text till the user hits enter and returns whatever the user typed as a `String`\n",
    "- `nextInt()` - reads in a single int (throws an error of type *InputMismatchException* if the user doesn't enter an int)\n",
    "- `nextDouble()` - reads in a single double (throws an error of type *InputMismatchException* if the user doesn't enter a double)\n",
    "\n",
    "You use your Scanner object to call any of these methods. In other words, if I named the Scanner I created above `in` then I would call methods on that variable, such as `in.next()`, `in.nextLine()`, etc. depending on what I wanted to read in from the user. A simple example is shown below:"
