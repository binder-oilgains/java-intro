If statements in Java are identical to C++ and are similar to Python, but remember that you will need squiggly braces (unlike in Python where you simply use whitespace). A simple example is below:"

This is because technically each of these operators works based on whatever value is stored by the variables on each side of the operator. For reference type variables, the value stored by the variable itself is a memory location to where the real data is, thus if you use these operators you will be comparing memory locations, not actual data, which is rarely what you want. Instead, you'll want to use methods such as `.equals()` for example:"
